## 🔥 Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Page Scrolling
**Issue:** Website was frozen, couldn't scroll
**Root Cause:** Missing `overflow-y: auto` on `.app-body`
**Fix:** Added `overflow-y: auto` in `app/globals.css:107`
**Test Result:** ✅ Scrolling works perfectly (body: 1590px, scrolled: 499px)

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Bottom Navigation Invisible
**Issue:** Bottom nav not showing - users couldn't navigate!
**Root Cause:** `fetch("/api/access")` not sending credentials/cookies
**Fix:** Added `credentials: 'same-origin'` to fetch in `components/BottomNavMobile.tsx:253`
**Impact:** **CRITICAL** - Without this, navigation was completely broken
**Test Result:** ⏳ Needs verification (fix applied, not yet retested)

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Lead Creation Non-Functional
**Issue:** "+ New Lead" button just showed an alert
**Root Cause:** No LeadForm component existed
**Fixes Applied:**
- Created `components/forms/LeadForm.tsx` - Full functional form
- Updated `app/(app)/sales/leads/page.tsx` - Integrated form with BottomSheet modal
- Added state management for modal open/close
- Added proper success/error handling
**Test Result:** ⏳ Needs verification (form created, not yet tested)
